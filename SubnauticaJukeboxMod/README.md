# To Do

* Get Spotify track name, time, position into the jukebox.

- I might need to use a reverse patch so I can access private methods.
- To use a reverse patch you need the class object. Maybe I can get the class object by using a Prefix and injecting my own Jukebox object into their code. That way I'd definitely have access to it!

* Get volume to change like it does in-game

* Think about whether playlists or track handling in general are worth considering.
